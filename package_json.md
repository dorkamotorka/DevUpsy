# package.json

package.json holds important information about the project. 
It contains human-readable metadata about the project (like the project name and description) as well as functional metadata like the package version number and a list of dependencies required by the application.
Generally it will most often be seen and used with Node.js projects, but it can be included in any project. 

It is auto-generated using the command:

	npm init
